    font weight: 
      1px =1/96th of inch
      1pt = 1/72nd of inch
      1em = 100% of parent  ---->relative size to the parent element where it is located

            and have to include it in CSS file like the way we are including a font family

            css_selector{
                      text-align: value

4. The CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding and Border
  box model: specifing width and height making a box virtualy
     it can be either in pixels or in  percentage
  border element: specifies thickness style and color for border
        border:thickness style color

    boder always goes outside which doesn't affect the content inside
  padding:
    It makes the text to go inwards, its width and height doesn't change while including padding
  margin:
    it goes outside from the box which also  not alter the border
      if two boxes are placed one after the other margin becomes common to both the element

  creating this type of artificial boxes is done through div element(content division element) <div> </div>
