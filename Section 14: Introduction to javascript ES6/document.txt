1. Introduction to Javascript:
  when web browser needs data it send its request to web servers and accepts the data from the servers
    when web browser becomes more dynamic it needs animation and user interface so it is needed to takeaway the servers and have the code able to run on the browser
    Inorder to do this created a scripting language

  name evolution : live script ----> jscript ----> ECMA script(standarised script)
java script contains elements
    it is a interpreted language
    modern javascript is used in frameworks ranging from frontend to backend development
    it is compatable with any browsers


  2. Javascript Alerts - Adding Behaviour to Websites

    working on chrome developers tool console or in source to write code

    alert("some text") ----->this creates popups
    prompt("some text") ----> this get input from user in live

3. Data Types
      way of classifying data to tell the computer how program intends to use data
    1.string
    2.Numbers
    3.Boolean

  checking type of datatype use --- typeof(checking content)

4. Javascript Variables
    syntax: var myName = "Agalya";
    var ---> keyword that constructs a container for that variable
    myName --->Name of container
    Agalya --->value


5. Coding Exercise 1: Javascript Variables Exercise
    Given the existing code below, can you write some code so that their values are switched around?
    var a = "3";
    var b = "8";

      So that the variable a holds the value "8".
      And the variable b holds the value "3".

    this is done by setting 3rd variable and done swapping

    
6. Naming and Naming Conventions for Javascript Variables:
  1. give meaningful names
  2.variable name shouldnot be var, but the variable name can cintains this keyword
  3. variable can't be numbers, but can contain numbers and can't start with numbers
  4. can't contain spaces
  5. can contain only letters, numbers, $, _
  6. use camlecase to name variables

7. String Concatenation
  anything inside " " are joined by '+' sign  provides cancatenated strings

8. String Lengths and Retrieving the Number of Characters
    variable.length() ---this retrives number of Characters that this variable holds 

9. Slicing and Extracting Parts of a String
    seperate string into required number of individual characters
  syntax: name.slice(x, y)
    x-->at position 
    y ---> continue upto this position not including this position

10. Challenge: Changing Casing in Text
  syntax: word.toUpperCase();
          word.toLowerCase();

11.Basic Arithmetic and the Modulo Operator in Javascript
  sum--> +
  difference ----> -
  multiplication --- > *
  division ---->/
  modulo ---> %

12. Increment and Decrement Expressions
  increment by x++
  decrement by x--

  assigning also done by +=, -=, *=, /= 

13. Functions Part 1: Creating and Calling Functions
  allows to create series of instructions packaged into a block of code
  calling a function executes series of instructions
    syntax:
        creating function: function fnName(){ ....}
        calling function:  fnName();
  alert---> used for user interaction
    console.log ---> show up only on console which is not intended for user interaction. it is meant for developer to debug code and print it on console
