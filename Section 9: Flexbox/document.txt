1. Display: Flex -- what is it and how is it works:
    flaot is used for magazine layouts
    flexbox is used for overall page structure

  flex displays like a column, used for arranging the contents in reasonable and commonly desirable way
wraps divs inside a container and target that container in css and set display to flex

.container{
        display:flex;  ----->creates flex container with 100% width
        gap: 10px;  --->this property to set gap may be static to desired value(10px) or dynamic as 1rem or 100%
    }
display:inline-flex --->It allows flex box to occupy as much as space it needs as other things can also go and occupy the container


2. Flex Direction - row and column layout
        How to modify the flex-box inorder to the way the layout we want

    This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container
    .container{
        flex-direction:row| column;
        }
    row : left to right   (actually increases the width)  
    column: top to bottom (actually increases the height)

flex-basis: 100px;  --->this increases width along its main axis 
this actually goes on to the child not with the container 


3.Flex Layout - align, justify, wrap
    1.order:0;  this property goes to child 
        picking out specific element from flrx-box and set its order property as we want
    2.flex-wrap --this property goes to child
        when window is run out of space in horizontal axis this works
        flex-wrap:nowrap
        flex-wrap:wrap
        flex-wrap:wrap-reverse
    3.justify-content: flex-start --set on parent container
            sets distribution along the main axis
        justify-content: flex-end;
        justify-content: center;
        justify-content: space-between
    4.align-items:flex-start --position of items
        distribution along vertical axis
    vh-viewport height
        align-items: flex-start| flex-end| center| baseline| stretch
        height:70vh;
when one particular item to align on different position use align-self: flex-start
    5.align-content: works when flex-box is wrapped

4. Flex Sizing- shrinking and growing
    if width of window gets shrinked flexbox also gets shrinked as they can accomadate all
priority:
    content-width< width< flex-basis< min-width/max-width
