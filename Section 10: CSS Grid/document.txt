1. Display: Grid
  A two dimensional layout
  arranges in row and column basis and equal gap between them

  .container{
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: values;
        grid-template-rows: values;
        gap: 10px}

2.Grid sizing:
  sizing rows and columns
    1.fixed size:
         grid-template-columns: fixed values;
        grid-template-rows:fixed values;
      This type is not responsive
    To make this to responsive setting any one content to auto 

      2.fractional size:
          values may be anything but it maintains the ratio as on increasing or decreasing the size of windows
            referred by 1fr or 3fr like this

      3.minmax size:
          limiting the size of column inside a grid
            minmax(200px,400px)
    when we don't define enough rows and columns to accomadate in grid we can place "grid-auto-rows:value;"

3. Grid item placement:
        used for layout items inside grid
          div-->grid-container
          grid item
          grid line---gap between the lines
          grid cell -->smallest unit in grid
          row tracks and column tracks

      using chrome developer tools we can identify grid numbers and used for arranging layout

          defining 
            grid-column-start:value
            grid-column-end:value
            grid-row-start:value
            grid-row-end:value
              start and end canbe from anyside
              the cumulative of above is noted as grid-area: 1/2/3/4
                where 1--->grid-row-start, 2--->grid-column-start, 3--->grid-row-end, 4--->grid-column-end
