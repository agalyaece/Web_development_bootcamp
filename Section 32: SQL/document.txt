CRUD operations:
  C -- Create
  R -- Read
  U -- Update
  D -- Delete


1.  SQL Commands: CREATE Table and INSERT Data
  The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table in a database.
  syntax:
      CREATE TABLE table_name (
                column1 datatype NOT NULL,
                column2 datatype,
                column3 datatype,
               ....
                PRIMARY KEY (column_name1)
            ); 
  when value is assigned to not null in case of creating record without a value for the primary key it will nor create in table it throws an error

The SQL INSERT INTO Statement
      -used to insert new records in a table.
It is possible to write the INSERT INTO statement in two ways:
    1. Specify both the column names and the values to be inserted
    2. adding values for all the columns of the table not need to specify the column names in the SQL query. 
   
    syntax: 
        INSERT INTO table_name
        VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...); 

2.  SQL Commands: READ, SELECT, and WHERE
      The SQL SELECT Statement
          The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.
    synatx: 
        SELECT column1, column2, ...
        FROM table_name;
      Select ALL columns
          If you want to return all columns, without specifying every column name, you can use the SELECT *
    syntax: 
          SELECT * FROM Customers;

The SQL WHERE Clause
      The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
          - extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.
  syntax:
      SELECT column1, column2, ...
      FROM table_name
      WHERE condition; --- operations for condition is available in docs

3.  Updating Single Values and Adding Columns in SQL
  The SQL UPDATE Statement
        The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.
  Syntax:
      UPDATE table_name
      SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
      WHERE condition; 

  SQL ALTER TABLE Statement
      - used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.
      - is also used to add and drop various constraints on an existing table.
syntax: To add a column in a table
      ALTER TABLE table_name
      ADD column_name datatype; 
  ALTER TABLE - DROP COLUMN
      ALTER TABLE table_name
      DROP COLUMN column_name;

4. SQL Commands: DELETE
  The SQL DELETE Statement
      - used to delete existing records in a table.
syntax:
    DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

5. Understanding SQL Relationships, Foreign Keys and Inner Joins
    SQL FOREIGN KEY Constraint
          The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.
          A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.
syntax:
      CREATE TABLE Orders (
          OrderID int NOT NULL,
          OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
          PersonID int,
          PRIMARY KEY (OrderID),
          FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
      ); 

INNER JOIN
    The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.
Join Products and Categories with the INNER JOIN keyword:
  syntax:       SELECT ProductID, ProductName, CategoryName
                FROM Products
                INNER JOIN Categories ON Products.CategoryID = Categories.CategoryID;
