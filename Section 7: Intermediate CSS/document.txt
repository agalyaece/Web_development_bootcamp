1. The Cascade - Specificity and Inheritance
    cascade system works based on hierarchy
  The thing which is atleast of cascade system works

there are 4 categories:
    1.position
    2.specificity
    3.type
    4.importance

  1.position:
  the css as external file or internal style element the css at last position works
    li{
        color:red; -----position1
        color:blue; ----position2
      }
    li{ color:green;} ----position3

      the one at position 3 works here

  2.specificity
      <li id="first-id" class="first-class" draggable >
      selecting ways include:

          4th ----> element
          3rd ----> class
         2nd ----> attribute
         1st ----> id

  3. type
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css"> --->external
      <style>  </style> ----internal
      <h1 style= "" > hello </h1> ----inline
       
        3rd ----> external
         2nd ----> internal
         1st ----> inline
      here inline targets the specific element

  4.Importance
      color: green !important; ----this takes the top level of priority

  at last these 4 also having priority
        
        4th ----> position
          3rd ----> specificity
         2nd ----> type
         1st ----> Importance
        


2. Combining CSS Selectors
    How to target specific element in style

    1.group selector:
        group = Apply to both selectors----same style to entire group
        selector,selector{
                color:blue;
        }

    2.child selector:
            apply to direct child of left side and has to be one level nested inside
       selector(parent) > selector(child){
                                  color:blue;
                                }
   3.descendent:
        apply to descendent of left side
          
          selector(ancestor) > selector(descendent){
                                  color:blue;
                                }

4.chaining:
  apply where all selectors are true
    no spaces in between the selectors
        selectorselector{
                color:blue;
  }

          3rd ----> classes
         2nd ----> id
         1st ----> element

5.combining combiners
            selectorselector can be of different combinations
        selector selectorselector{
                font-size:5rem;
        }   


3. CSS Positioning:
relative, absolute, fixed, static positioning

  1.static: HTML default flow in positioning items
  2.relative: position relative to default position, takes original position and apply changes  and move it to some position where it should be, relative to its suposed position
  3.absolute:position relative to nearest positional ancestor (or) top left corner of webpage
        if 1st condition becomes invalid 2nd comes to work
      z-index it determines which element goes on top of z-axis, thinking about webpage as a graph 
  4.fixed : position relative to top left corner of browser window


 4. [Project] CSS Flag
     using about combining selectors and CSS specificity to design a flag
    The flag is 900px by 600px and the circle is 200px by 200px and inner blue rectangle is 900px by 300px.
    writing internal css and made absolute and relative position to position these rectangles and circles in place as per the goal
    finally modifying the paragraph element to make changes in color and position of words to the flag
