1. Backend Web Development 
    full stack ---> front end + back end
  front end --->user can see or hear or interact with
  back end ---> user can't make a interaction 

  3main components
    1.server
    2. application
    3.database

  1.server
    a computer that connected to a network can act as a server
    server for live website shouldbe ON 24/7
    listern for incomming requests from browsers from all around the world

2.appliction
  a logic that runs on the server
  determines how to respond to the requests from the browsers
  it send back the retrived data, html or sometimes the status code(application not know how to respond)

3.database
    basically not a requirement of web app 
    usually webapp becames more complex  and larger , so it needs to store user data. this is why database needed
    database is a permanent form of storage for the data

webpage ---> only having front-end  i.e., having bits of html, css, js
webapp ---> able to do something make a response to request for the user given information
