  span in middle of another element --- unique thing to get modified using css

    having different values for display property alter the display for different screens

    1.block: allows to set height and width
    2.inline: it is default as per the content of the screen, can't set the size for the elements
    3.inline-block: allows both inline and block property
    4. None: clears the already applied display on the screen

2. CSS Float

      put in css styles as 
   selector { float: left (or) right; }

3. How to Create Responsive Websites
  making websites look good on all screen sizes(desktop, laptops, tabs, phone)

    There are 4 ways to create it:
      1.Media queries
      2.css grid
      3.css flexbox
      4.external frameworks eg:bootstrap

4. Media Queries
        adding breakpoints to define rsponsive layouts

        @media(max-width:600px){
                      selector{
                                attribute:value;
                      }
                    }
            breakpoints maybe max-width or min-width changed according to the requirements

      combine breakpoints: ---using various combinations to achieve this goal
          @media(min-width:481px) and (max-width:1200px){
                /* styles for screens between 481px and 1200px*/ 
              }

           @media(max-width:481px) and (min-width:1200px){
                /* styles for screens lessthan 481px and greater than 1200px*/ 
              }
      device:
         @media screen(orientation: landscape){
               /* styles for landscape orientation*/ 
              }
        we can also use print in place of screen to make the print property to work
