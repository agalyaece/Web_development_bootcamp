2. Introduction to the Document Object Model (DOM)
  when our website to be interactive,then we want to change the parts of  website in the flag(responding to a click, want to update our websites)--- here comes DOM
  it catalogue the webpage into individual objects that we can select and manipulate
  converting html page into DOM is done by browser while loading webpage
  turns each of element and its associated data into tree structure --relationship matters in tree diagram

  steps to navigate : tap into DOM using javascript and navigate through this tree structure

      document.firstElementChild; ---->this tap into first child in tree
      manipulation is done by ----variableName.innerHTML = "value assigning" 

      selecting elements and doing things is done by
          document.querySelector("value to select").click();

      objects inside DOM contains:  
                1.properties: --- that describes something about objects denoted by .notation followed by property name
                    in properties we can get and set properties
                2.Methods : ---things that can do something (functions that object can do) denoted by .notation method name()
