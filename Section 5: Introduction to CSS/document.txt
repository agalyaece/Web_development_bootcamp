1. Why do we need CSS? 
  To style websites

  cascading --> type of language
  StyleSheets ----> type of language that specifies how the page look like

  to attach styles(i.e., font,color,spacing) to html document
  CSS language is human readable and writable and expressess style in common desktop publishing treminology

2. How to add CSS?
    inline --->single element
    internal --->single webpage
    external  --->multipage website
  
  Inline: 
    <tag attribute_name= " value for attribute"> </tag>
    -----goes into same line as  the particulae html element
  here style attribute is available globally
  inline is used whenever we want to add single time in html file

  Internal:
      can apply to anywhere in html document, inside we can target or select as many elements as we want
      used for applying to only one html document, i.e., any file enclosed between <html>  </html> tag

  so if we are having multipage website it doesn't work
  
  <html>
    <head>  ------------should goes inside a head part
      <style> ---------->style tag represents a css attribute
        html{ ----------->selector comes before the curley brackets
              background:red; ---->CSS should be inside a curley braces
            }
       </style>
     </head>
   </html>     

  External:
    CSS --- live completely as a seperate file which holds CSS rules for webpages
      this is used most common

      <link
        rel="stylesheet"  --------->specifies relation
        href="path to the stylesheet"  --------->specifies location to where it should be linked
      />
