1.What We'll Make: Drum Kit 
  program that works like a drum kit
  
2. Adding Event Listeners to a Button
    The addEventListener() method of the EventTarget interface sets up a function that will be called whenever the specified event is delivered to the target.
  syntax:
      addEventListener(type, listener)
      type: A case-sensitive string representing the event type to listen for.
      listener: an object that implements the Event interface) when an event of the specified type occurs.This must be null, an object with a handleEvent() method, or a JavaScript function.

3. Higher Order Functions and Passing Functions as Arguments
        addEventListener takes two inputs of which one is a function
        function can be named or anonymous function and is passing as an input to addEventListener

        syntax:
            $0.addEventListener(input1, input2) ---->input2 is a function
