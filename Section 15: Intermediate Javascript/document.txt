1. Random Number Generation in Javascript: Building a Love Calculator
    var n = Math.random(); ----->always produces a random number between 0 and 0.999(upto 16 decimal places)
    we can multiply the number with out limit to get the desired value( n= n * number limit)

2. Control Statements: Using If-Else Conditionals & Logic
  By testing the condition we get control of the flow
  syntax:
      if (track === "clear"){
            //do something
          } else{
              do something
          }      

3. Comparators and Equality
    === ----> is equal to
    !== ---->is not equal to
    > --->greater than
    < --->lesser than
    >= --->greater than or equal to
    <= --->lesser than or equal to

  if we put "==" in comparison it evaluates only the values not get into the datatypes
  if we put "===" in comparison it evaluates both the values and the datatypes

4. Combining Comparators
  is done by three operators
      && --- and
      || --- or
      ! --- not

5. Coding Exercise 4: BMI Calculator Advanced (IF/ELSE)
  Writing a function that outputs (returns) a different message depending on the BMI.
  conditions:
    BMI <18.5, the output should be: "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you are underweight."
    BMI 18.5-24.9, the output should be "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you have a normal weight."
    BMI >24.9, the output should be "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you are overweight."

      this is done by comparing the bmi values calculated using combining compatators for evaluating the conditions
