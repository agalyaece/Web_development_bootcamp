1. Random Number Generation in Javascript: Building a Love Calculator
    var n = Math.random(); ----->always produces a random number between 0 and 0.999(upto 16 decimal places)
    we can multiply the number with out limit to get the desired value( n= n * number limit)

2. Control Statements: Using If-Else Conditionals & Logic
  By testing the condition we get control of the flow
  syntax:
      if (track === "clear"){
            //do something
          } else{
              do something
          }      

3. Comparators and Equality
    === ----> is equal to
    !== ---->is not equal to
    > --->greater than
    < --->lesser than
    >= --->greater than or equal to
    <= --->lesser than or equal to

  if we put "==" in comparison it evaluates only the values not get into the datatypes
  if we put "===" in comparison it evaluates both the values and the datatypes

4. Combining Comparators
  is done by three operators
      && --- and
      || --- or
      ! --- not

5. Coding Exercise 4: BMI Calculator Advanced (IF/ELSE)
  Writing a function that outputs (returns) a different message depending on the BMI.
  conditions:
    BMI <18.5, the output should be: "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you are underweight."
    BMI 18.5-24.9, the output should be "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you have a normal weight."
    BMI >24.9, the output should be "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you are overweight."

      this is done by comparing the bmi values calculated using combining compatators for evaluating the conditions


6.Coding Exercise 5: Leap Year Challenge Exercise
    Writing a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year.

    This is how to work out whether if a particular year is a leap year:
        A year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4 ;
        except if that year is also evenly divisible by 100;
        unless that year is also evenly divisible by 400.
   
    using if/else if/ else condition to solve this

7.Collections: Working with Javascript Arrays
    for storing datas in variables limited to store a single piece of data
array ---> store a collection of related items into the same container/variable

    var eggs = [1,2,3,4]
    var myEggs = eggs[1] ---> retriving data
    eggs.length --->gives length of array
    eggs.include --->checks if array includes this item or not, it retuns boolean

8. Adding Elements and Intermediate Array Techniques
    adding new item into the array ---> array_name.push()  ----->always adds at the end of the array
    delete last item from list ----> array_name.pop() 

    fizzbuzz program to execute push function

9. Coding Exercise 6: Who's Buying Lunch? Code Challenge 
    write a function which will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

used Math.random() and a math.floor to select the random array list number
then used array retrival for that randomly selected number

10.  Control Statements: While Loops
    syntax:
        while(something is true){
                    //do something
                    }

11. Control Statements: For Loops
    syntax:
        for(var i=0; i<2; i++){  
                    //do something
                    }
            i=0 --->start
            i<2 --->end
            i++ ---> change in value
allows to count in any direction, increase/decrease the values

        when to use for loop and while loop
            while loop -----> state
            for loop -----> iterate

12. Coding Exercise 7: The Fibonacci Exercise
    every number is the sum of the two previous ones. The first two numbers in the sequence must be 0 and 1.

        used if/else if --- to provide an array for 1st two numbers
        then calculation is done by for loop iteration for upto n number of values
